// starting docker with java today
//	if u work with a team and u work on your laptop and all the testing and stuff just on ur
//	laptop and then another team or a testers want the project sometimes it does not work on
//	their laptops and they have to install all the libraries and configuration to make it work so
//	in this case we use docker to containerize the app and just give it to them with all the things
//	that makes the app run
//	and if they were able to do all these stuff and made it work we give it to ops team to deploy
//	it they have to do all these stuff again and before docker we used virtualization and also
//	might not work and also virtual machines are heavy
//	see SWE Design course to see the difference between Docker and VM
//	 with Docker u give the entire Container  to them
//	 so they are running the Software inside the container
//	 inside the container we have everything we needed to run the app on the Dev laptop
//! and image of the app is just snapshot from it , image is where we put everything like repo and
// code , container is running instance of an image or in other words we have a container on our
// machine and the image is  a blueprint from the container we have on
// our machine and give it to them, it is a lightweight file of my running container,
//	 and from one image we can run multiple containers to scale it and simply they load the image
//	 to run the container
//	 and we can run the same container in multiple instances to scale it
//	 first we want to download images to see how things work then we will create our images
//	to delete the image we have to delete the container first



//	1 now he explained the first way and it is make a container first and then from command line
//	 we make the configuration and put the project inside it and run it


//	 forget about the first way and we will do the second way

//  2 the second way is to have docker file inside each project and thats it but this is if we have
// a lot of projects and we should not do the first way but at the end we just in these to ways
//to automate this we use docker file for all projects and with one command we can create the image
//	first we clean and create jar file (clean package ) without skipping tests , then dockerfile
//	more steps	in dockerfile , in docker file we can automate the clean package instead doing it manually
//	anytime we make a change in the code we have to clean and create jar file and then create/build
//	the image again and run the container again

//	then is docker compose
//	 before that i want to create a quick spring boot project here
//	now it is used to work with multiple images/containers but still we have to make docker file
//	so at the end the is a docker file inside each project or service and then docker compose to
//	make multiple containers , more steps in docker compose



//	now docker volumes
//	 we use it to not lose data when the container is not running or removed
//	without docker we use database on our machine and the data is stored on our machine
//	but with docker if we have database inside a container and the container is not running
//	the data is lost so we use docker volumes to store the data on our machine even if it is in a
//	container , it is in docker compose file
//	make sure in app properties to write update so the tables are created automatically and not
//	create so it does not try to create the tables again and again
